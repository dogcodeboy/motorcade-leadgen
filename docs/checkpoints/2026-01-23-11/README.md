# Checkpoint 2026-01-23-11 — Session Cleanup + Deprecation Policy

Purpose:
- Establish canonical policy: broken/superseded items get moved to `deprecated/` (no deletions during active build).
- Update RUNBOOK to reflect current reality and keep nginx frozen.
- Prepare session handoff for the next subsystem (Podman / containers).
