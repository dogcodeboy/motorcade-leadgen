# Vehicle Doctrine

Core principles:
- Client funds acquisition/setup; Motorcade owns vehicles.
- Wrap required with Texas license number when applicable by law.
- Operating fees apply per shift; escrow maintains lifecycle funding.

Rates:
- Sedan fuel/maintenance: $80/shift
- SUV fuel/maintenance: $120/shift

Armored SUV:
- $120/shift + $8–$16 per mile maintenance surcharge.
- Armored glass degradation (fogging) expected; replacement is client-funded.
