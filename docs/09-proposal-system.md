# Proposal & Contract Generation System

## Purpose
The Proposal System converts an approved assessment into a legally enforceable, operationally hardened security program contract.
It exists to prevent unsafe, illegal, or economically destructive engagements before operations begin.

This system is not a sales flexibility tool.
