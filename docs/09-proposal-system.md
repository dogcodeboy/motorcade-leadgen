# Proposal & Contract Generation System

## Purpose
Transform an approved assessment into a **legally defensible, operationally enforceable** security program proposal and contract artifacts.

This system is:
- not a quote generator
- not a negotiation tool by default
- doctrine-enforcing and audit-driven

## Output
- Standard proposal length: **40+ pages**
- Output formats:
  - PDF (primary)
  - DOCX (internal only, watermark "DO NOT EDIT")
- All artifacts are versioned, timestamped, and immutable after issuance.

## Proposal Chapter Order (Fixed)

2. Program Overview & Philosophy
3. Scope of Services
4. Staffing Model & Coverage
5. Executive Protection Doctrine (if applicable)
6. Rapid Response & Continuity

22. Appendices (site-specific tables/maps)

## Contract Term
### Default (Primary Business Model)
- **Five (5) year Master Services Agreement (MSA)** initial term
- Auto-renewal unless terminated by Motorcade
- Applies to ongoing programs (site security, long-term EP/PPO, multi-location, any program requiring dedicated assets/escrow/MCC)

### One-Time / Short-Term Exception (Allowed)
Motorcade may accept **one-time or short-term** engagements (e.g., a one-time party needing armed guards) only when:
- engagement is event-based, single occurrence, non-recurring
- **100% paid upfront in full**
- no installment billing
- accepted at Motorcade's sole discretion
- priced at a premium

If the client repeats or scope expands: mandatory reassessment and conversion to long-term program at Motorcade's discretion.

## Termination & Breach Architecture
### Client termination standard (extremely restricted)
Client may terminate only if all are true:
1. breach is **material/substantial**
2. breach is **repetitive**
3. breach is **uncorrected**
4. written notice delivered
5. cure period expires without cure

Single incidents, dissatisfaction, or preference disputes do not qualify.

### Early termination by client (default consequence)
If the client terminates early without qualifying breach, client owes:
- **100% of remaining contract value**
- plus damages (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary) as defined below
- no mitigation obligation

#### Damages architecture (explained in the contract)
- Primary: unpaid invoices, remaining value, minimum commitments
- Secondary: demobilization, reassignment, onboarding/training sunk costs, disruption
- Tertiary: foreseeable impacts including loss of employment continuity, displacement impacts, reputational/administrative/compliance overhead

Damages are framed as foreseeable, reasonable estimates (not punitive).

### Motorcade termination (broad & immediate)
Motorcade may terminate immediately for:
- non-payment
- misrepresentation
- interference
- refusal to fund required assets
- risk escalation beyond assessed scope
- safety concerns
- legal/reputational exposure

## Staffing Control & Replacement
### Staffing authority
So long as Motorcade complies with the agreement:
- Motorcade retains sole discretion over staffing, rotations, replacements, and redeployments
- compliant replacements/redirects do not constitute breach
- client preferences are non-binding unless explicitly amended

### Client-requested guard removal (without cause)
If client requests removal without cause:
- client bears full replacement costs
- client funds equipment kit: **$5,000–$10,000 per guard** (site-dependent)
- costs due prior to replacement deployment

Repeated preference removals increment the Client Interference Score.

### Assignment stability window
- Minimum stability window (configurable, e.g., 60–90 days)
- preference-based changes are deferred or charged

## Risk Escalation Framework
### Escalation events
Examples include credible threats, stalking indicators, media exposure spikes, unrest near site, and client-caused risk increase.

### Automatic effects
Motorcade may, without renegotiation:
- increase rates
- add staffing
- require armored vehicles
- deploy supervisor/MCC
- require PI services

Refusal = interference.

## Vehicles, Costs, Escrow
### Ownership + upfront funding
- Client funds acquisition + setup; Motorcade owns vehicle(s)
- client-funded vinyl wrap required where applicable and must include Texas license number
- no refund/buyback on termination

### EP vehicle rules
- EP always requires an SUV.
- Ongoing EP: Motorcade-owned SUV; armored optional based on risk.
- Short-term EP: rental premium black SUV permitted; **no armor**.

### Supervisor command vehicle
- Multi-site contracts require Supervisor SUV + Mobile Command Center (MCC)
- Walking-distance exception only when all sites are within walking distance (<= 0.25 miles / <= 5 minutes) and truly share the same operational environment

### Operating fees
- Sedan: $80/shift fuel/maintenance
- SUV: $120/shift fuel/maintenance

### Maintenance escrow (owned vehicles)
- Each client has a separate maintenance escrow ledger controlled by Motorcade
- excess funds retained by Motorcade at contract end
- vehicle replacement is client-funded minus escrow offset

### Armored SUV operating cost
- $120/shift + $8–$16 per mile maintenance surcharge
- Armored glass fogging/degradation expected; client funds replacement; Motorcade determines when replacement required

## Temporary Staffing Addendums (Hardened)
### Allowed mechanism
Clients may temporarily add guards via a written Addendum for a defined period/event. Addendums expand coverage only and do not modify base term, termination, damages, or staffing authority.

### Requirements
Each Addendum must specify:
- delta guards, armed/unarmed, role category
- start/end date (auto-expire)
- premium pricing
- any additional assets required

### No implied availability
Past acceptance does not guarantee future availability.

### Premium multiplier
Addendum staffing is billed at base rate x premium multiplier (configurable; executive-only).

### Frequency threshold (internal)
If Addendums exceed X times in Y months, system triggers reassessment; Motorcade may convert to permanent scope, raise rates, require assets, or refuse further Addendums.

### No addendums during breach/cure
If a breach notice/cure period is active, addendums are disallowed.

### Availability/suitability
Request != approval; no best-efforts language.

### Addendums do not pause escalation
Addendums do not suspend escalation or reassessment triggers.

### Cool-down window
After addendum ends, cool-down applies (configurable); further addendums require Motorcade approval.

## Supervisor Requirements (Reconciled)
Supervision is command authority, not headcount.

Supervisor required when any of the following are true:
- multi-location (unless walking-distance exception)
- EP + site security concurrently
- RRT deployed
- addendum expands complexity/footprint
- escalation active
- interference score exceeds threshold
- armored vehicles deployed

Supervisor authority includes:
- reassign/reposition guards and RRT
- remove guards for cause
- suspend operations for safety
- trigger reassessment
- recommend termination

Addendums may trigger supervisor/MCC deployment at client cost.

## Guard Safety Supremacy
Guard safety supersedes service continuity.
Motorcade may reposition, suspend, withdraw, or escalate without breach/penalty.

## Financial Health Gate
Contracts require:
- ACH authorization
- advance deposits
- reserve thresholds

Payment failure automatically restricts expansion and enables termination.

## Overrides & Audit
- Sales: no overrides
- Executive: exceptional overrides only, audit logged
- All artifacts are versioned and immutable after issuance.

Governing principle:
> The proposal system prevents unsafe, illegal, or economically destructive engagements before operations begin.
