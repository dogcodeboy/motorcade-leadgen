# Canonical Context — Motorcade LeadGen & Proposal Engine

## Read This First (Mandatory)
This document defines the **non-negotiable context, intent, and constraints** of the Motorcade LeadGen, Assessment, and Proposal Engine.

If any other document, discussion, or implementation conflicts with this file,
**this file takes precedence**.

This system is **design-complete**. Future work is implementation only unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## 1. What This System Is (And Is Not)

### This system IS:
- A **Security Program Control System**
- A doctrine-enforcement engine
- A client qualification and risk filtering system
- A hardened proposal and contract generator
- A protection mechanism for guards, assets, vehicles, capital, and legal posture

### This system is NOT:
- A traditional lead-gen funnel
- A flexible sales tool
- A CRM replacement
- A discounting or negotiation engine
- A “take any client” platform

Clients are **selected**, not chased.

---

## 2. Canonical Business Model (LOCKED)

### Primary Clients
- Long-term **24/7 security programs**
- Minimum budget: **$60–$80+ per hour per armed guard**

### Coverage Model
- **3 × 10-hour shifts**
- **30 hours per day of coverage**
- Guard overlap for handoffs
- Objective: guards work **4 days / 40 hours per week**, no overtime
- Every other week includes a paid training day

---

## 3. Staffing Doctrine (LOCKED)

### Site Security
- Minimum **2 armed guards per site**
- Unarmed guards may extend coverage but **never without armed guards**

### Executive Protection (EP / PPO)
- **1 PPO = 1 protected person**
- PPO responsible only for that person
- Multiple PPOs allowed
- Non-primary PPOs form the **Rapid Response Team (RRT)**

---

## 4. Vehicles & Fleet Doctrine (LOCKED)

- Vehicles are **client-funded**, **Motorcade-owned**
- EP always requires an SUV
- Armored SUVs incur:
  - $120 / shift
  - $8–$16 per mile surcharge
- Armored glass replacement is client-funded

---

## 5. Supervisor & Command Authority (LOCKED)

Supervisor required when:
- multiple locations
- EP + site security
- RRT active
- armored vehicles
- Addendums increase complexity
- risk escalation active

---

## 6. Contracts & Legal Posture (LOCKED)

- Default **5-year contracts**
- Client termination only for material, repetitive, uncorrected breach
- Early termination: **100% remaining contract value + damages**
- Motorcade may terminate immediately for safety, interference, or non-payment

---

## 7. One-Off / Event Security Exception

- Allowed
- **100% paid upfront**
- Premium pricing
- No continuity

---

## 8. Temporary Staffing Addendums (LOCKED)

- Time-limited
- Premium
- Non-precedential
- May trigger reassessment or supervisor deployment

---

## 9. Risk Escalation Philosophy (LOCKED)

Motorcade may escalate staffing, rates, assets, or PI use without renegotiation.

---

## 10. Guard Safety Supremacy (LOCKED)

Guard safety supersedes service continuity.

---

## 11. Financial Controls (LOCKED)

- ACH required
- Advance deposits
- Immediate termination for non-payment

---

## 12. Deployment & Recovery Philosophy

- Containerized
- Subdomain-based
- Local-first backup with GUI recovery kit

---

## 13. Rules for Future Changes

Doctrine is locked. Partial updates prohibited.

---

## Final Authority Statement

This repository encodes Motorcade’s operational, legal, and financial doctrine.
