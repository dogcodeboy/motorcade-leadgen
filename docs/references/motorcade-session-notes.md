# Motorcade Session Notes

This repository's doctrine and contract posture were derived from prior Motorcade design sessions (see `motorcade-chatGPT-session.txt` in the main project context).

Key themes:
- enterprise posture, assessment-first
- avoid quote-engine behavior
- hardened long-term commitments
- protect staffing stability and asset economics
- strict termination/damages posture
