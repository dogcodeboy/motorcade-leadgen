# Overview

Motorcade LeadGen is a doctrine-enforced system for generating and qualifying high-value security leads by location, converting assessments into pricing/staffing/asset requirements, and producing hardened proposals/contracts.

Design goals:
- Preserve Motorcade's enterprise posture (assessment-first, program-based).
- Make doctrine **unbreakable** (no silent weakening by sales/ops).
- Provide clean integration with the Motorcade platform and the public WordPress site.

Key outputs:
- Assessment record
- Risk score + escalation triggers
- Staffing plan (incl. overlaps/handoffs)
- Asset plan (vehicles, MCC, equipment kits)
- Proposal PDF (40+ pages)
- Addendum PDFs for temporary expansions
- Audit trail
