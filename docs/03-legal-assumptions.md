# Legal Assumptions (Texas)

This project assumes Texas private security operations and executive protection are governed by Texas DPS / Private Security Bureau statutes and rules.

A reference PDF (older but still largely applicable with minor updates) is tracked in `docs/references/texas-psb-notes.md`.

**Important:** Final contract language and any statutory interpretations should be reviewed by Texas counsel before production use.
