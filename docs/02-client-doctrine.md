# Client Doctrine (High-Level)

Primary targets:
- 24/7 or ongoing security programs.
- Budgets in the $60–$80/hr per guard range (or higher depending on risk).
- Minimum staffing for site work: **minimum two armed** (unarmed only as extension coverage, never standalone).

Shift model:
- Standard: **3 x 10-hour shifts per day** (supports 4-day/40-hr guard weeks and OT prevention).
- Handoffs are structured, controlled, and minimized.

Executive Protection (EP/PPO):
- PPO assigned to a specific protected person; duty of care limited to that person.
- RRT supports primaries and assumes responsibility only if formally reassigned or if primary becomes incapacitated.
