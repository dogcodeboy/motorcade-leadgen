# Decisions (Canon)

- LeadGen runs as independent tool (subdomain) integrated with motorcade.vip.
- Default contract term: 5-year MSA for ongoing programs.
- One-time event security allowed only if paid upfront in full.
- Temporary staffing expansions via Addendum with hardened rules (premium, thresholds, cooldown, no implied availability).
- Minimum site staffing: 2 armed per site; unarmed only as extension.
- EP/PPO doctrine: 1 PPO per protected person per shift; RRT supports primaries.
- Vehicles client-funded, Motorcade-owned; wrap includes Texas license number.
- Operating fees: Sedan $80/shift, SUV $120/shift.
- Armored SUV: $120/shift + $8-$16/mile; client funds armored glass replacement.
- Maintenance escrow per client (Motorcade-controlled; remainder retained by Motorcade at contract end).
- Multi-site requires Supervisor SUV + MCC, with walking-distance exception.
- Guard safety supremacy clause.
- Financial health gate (ACH, deposits, reserves).
- Backup/recovery: local-first; GUI mini-app Phase 1; remote recovery Phase 2 later.
